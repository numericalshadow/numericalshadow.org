Let $M_n$ will be the set of all matrices of dimension $n$. We will consider linear mapping transforming given matrix into another matrix. Such mapping can be represented by operator sum representation (Kraus representation) as for some matrices $A_i$. The special linear mapping transforming state into another state is well-known as quantum channel. One would like to consider a recovery channel $R$ such that $R (X) = X$whenever$PXP=X$for some orthogonal projection$P$. The range space of $P$ is known as a quantum error correction code of the channel $\\Phi$. The task is finding $P$ with a maximum rank. For a given quantum channel $\\Phi$ this problem is equivalent to existing scalars $\\lambda_{i,j} \\in \\mathbb{C}$ such that This leads to the study higher rank numerical range. We can also naturally extend above error correction scheme [1]. Now we consider that for a given quantum channel $\\Psi$ we would like to find a recovery channel $R$ such that for each $B \\in M_k$ for some $A_B \\in M_p$. Analogously, his problem can be is reduced to showing that such recovery channel $R$ exists if and only if there are scalars $\\lambda_{ijrs} \\in \\mathbb{C}$ such that where $P_{kl} = ( *k ) *{n-pk} $ with fixed an arbitrary orthonormal basis $\\{ e_1, \\ldots, e_p \\}$ in $\\mathbb{C}^p$.

Imagine that the matrices are points in space $\\mathrm{L}(\\mathbb{C}^d)$ and the distance between them is bounded by small constant $0 &lt; c \\ll 1$. We will take two unitary matrices - matrix $U \\in \\mathrm{U}(\\mathbb{C}^d)$ and its perturbation $V (^d)$i.e.$||U-V||_c$ by using $\\infty$-Schatten norm. We want to determine the path connecting these points given by smooth curve. To do so, we fix continuous parametric (by parameter $t$) curve $U(t) (^d)$for any$t [0,1]$ with boundary conditions $U(0) := U$ and $U(1) := V$. The most natural and also the shortest curve connecting $U$ and $V$ is geodesic [1] given by where $\\mathrm{Log}$ is the matrix function such that it changes eigenvalues $\\lambda \\in \\lambda(U)$ into $\\log(\\lambda(U))$, where $-i((U)) (-, ]$. We will study how the numerical range$W(U(t))$ will be changed depending on parameter $t$. Let $H := -i ( U^V )$. Let us see that$H (^d)$and$W(H) (-, ]$ for any $U,V \\in \\mathrm{U}(\\mathbb{C}^d)$. We can also observe that where (\\widetilde{U} := V^\\dagger U V \\in \\mathrm{U}(\\mathbb{C}^d)). Hence, without loss of generality we can assume that $H$ is a diagonal matrix. Moreover, we can assume that $D \\ge 0$ which follows from simple calculations Let us see that the numerical range of $U(t)$ for any $t \\in [0,1]$ is invariant to above calculations although the trajectory of $U(t)$ is changed. Therefore, we will consider the curve where $t \\in [0,1]$ and $U (^d)$,$D_+ (^d)$such that$D_+ 0$. We will focus on the behavior of the spectrum of the unitary matrices $U(t)$, which will reveal the behavior of $W(U(t))$ for relatively small parameter $t$. Without loss of generality we can assume that $ ( D_+ )=1$. Together with the fact that$D_+ (^d)$and$D_+ 0$ we can note that $D_+ = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} p_i \\ket{i}\\bra{i}$, where $p ^d$ is a probability vector. Let us also define the set for some matrix $M \\in \\mathrm{L}(\\mathbb{C}^d)$ which consists of unit eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of the matrix $M$.

If ${ S^U} _{i=1}^d\\ p_i ||^2=0$, then $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $UV(t)$; . 2. If $|\\{p_i: p_i&gt;0\\}|=l&lt;k$, then $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $UV(t)$ and $r(\\lambda) \\ge k-l$; . 3. Each eigenvalue of product $UV(t)$ moves counterclockwise or stays in the initial position as parameter $t$ increases; . 4. If $k=1$, then for small $t 0$; . 5. Let $Q:=I_{U,\\lambda}^\\dagger D_+ I_{U,\\lambda}$ and $\\lambda_1(Q) \\le \\lambda_2(Q) \\le \\ldots \\le \\lambda_k(Q)$. Then we have for small $t \\geq 0$ and eigenvector $\\ket{ x_j}$ corresponding to $\\lambda_j \\in \\lambda(U)$ is given by where $ S^{Q}_{_j(Q)}$; . 6. For each $j=1,\\ldots,d$ we have Moreover, . Proof of this therorem you can see in [2]. Intuitively speaking, this theorem gives us equations which one can use to predict behaviour of $W(UV(t))$. Observe the postulate $(6)$ fully determines the movement of the spectrum. However, this is a theoretical statement and in practice determining the function $t $ is a numerically complex task. The postulates $(1)-(5)$ play a key role in numerical calculations of $W(UV(t))$. The most important fact comes from $(3)$ which says that all eigenvalues move in the same direction or stay in the initial position. The instantaneous velocity of a given eigenvalue in general case is given in $(5)$, while in the case of eigenvalue with multiplicity equal one, the instantaneous velocity is determined by $(4)$. We see that whenever the spectrum of the matrix $U$ is not degenerated, calculating these velocities is easy. What is more, when some eigenvalue is degenerated, the postulate $(5)$ not only gives us method to calculate the trajectory of this eigenvalue, but also determines the form of corresponding eigenvector. It is worth noting that the postulates $(4),(5)$ give us only an approximation of the velocities, so despite being useful in numerical calculations, these expressions are valid only in the neighbourhood of $t=0$. Moreover, sometimes we are able to precisely specify this velocities. This happens in the cases presented in $(1),(2)$. Whenever the calculated velocity is zero we know for sure that this eigenvalue will stay in the initial position. According to the postulate $(2)$ the same happens when the multiplicity of the eigenvalue is greater than the number of positive elements of vector $p$. ",

Red colour denotes instantaneous velocity equal to one and blue colour corresponds to the instantaneous velocity equal to zero. Example 1 . Diagonal matrix $U=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; \\ii &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -\\ii \\end{pmatrix}.$ We act on two subspaces with probability $p_1 = 1/3$ and $p_2 = 2/3$. Eigenvalues $-1$ and $-\\ii$ stay in the initial position, because they lie on the orthogonal subspace to subspace of which we acting on. Example 2 . Random matrix $U$ of dimension $3 \\times 3$. Vector of probability is equal $p = (1,0,0)$. All eigenvalues have nonzero velocity, so degeneration is impossible. Example 3 . Matrix $U$ of dimension $5\\times 5$ having eigenbasis given by the Fourier matrix. Vector of probability is equal $p = (3/8,1/4,1/4,1/8,0)$. Because standard basis and Fourier basis are mutually unbiased, velocities are similar, which implies the shape changes slightly in time. Example 4 . Matrix $U$ with eigenvalues $(1,e^{/6}, , , , -1, -1)$. We act on two subspaces with probability $p_1 = 1/3$ and $p_2 = 2/3$. In this case the eigenvalue$$ is three fold degenerated, so it stays in the initial position. More examples you can find in [2]. ",

    "content": "A doubly stochastic matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n }$ is a matrix for which the entries are non-negative while the row and column sums are all equal to one $\\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij} = 1 \\text{ for } i=1,\\ldots,n$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{ij} = 1 \\text{ for } j=1,\\ldots,n$ . Theorem . Let A be $4\\times 4$ doubly stochastic matrix. Then, $ W(A)$consists of elliptical arcs and line segments if and only if\\(:= (A) - 1 + $is an eigenvalue of A (multiple, if\\)\\mu =1$$). If, in addition$ A - 1 - 3&gt;0 , (A -1 - 3)^2 - (A^A) + 1 +2 + ^2 &gt; 0 $$$$ . then $W(A)$ also has corner points at $\\mu$ and 1, and thus four flat portions on the boundary. Otherwise, 1 is the only corner point of $W(A)$ and $\\partial W(A)$ consists of two flat portions and one elliptical arc. Example 1 . Consider the doubly stochastic matrix : $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0&amp;1/3&amp;1/4&amp;5/12\\ 1/3&amp;0&amp;1/2&amp;1/6\\ 1/4&amp;9/32&amp;1/4&amp;1/6\\ 5/12&amp;37/96&amp;0&amp;19/96 \\end{pmatrix}$ . Using above theorem, we compute $\\mu = -1/3.$ By calculating the characteristic polynomial and computin the conditions from Theorem we have that one of condition is negative, Theorem 1 states that $\\partial W(A)$ has two flat portions and one elliptical arc. Indeed, A reduces unitarily to $(1) \\oplus A_1$ for some $3\\times 3$ matrix $A_1$, and in Fig. 1 we give $W(A)$, and the horizontal ellipse it contains, $W(A_1)$. |   | . | | . | Fig. 1 Numerical range of $A$ with two flat portions and an elliptical arc on the boundary, and the ellipse it contains. The eigenvalues of A are indicated by the points. | . Example 2 .

The formulas in inequalities on Theorem evaluate to $7/24$ and $59/576$ respectively, so the number of flat portions is still the same. However, Fig. 2 shows that $W(A)$ is the convex hull of a vertical ellipse and the point 1, as opposed to the horizontal ellipse in the previous example. Indeed, the eigenvalues marked in the graph include a complex conjugate pair. |   | . | | . | Fig. 2 Numerical range $A$ with two flat portions and an elliptical arc on the boundary, and the contained vertical ellipse.

Since then their theory and applications have been advanced with remarkable enthusiasm. The sequence of papers [1], [2], [3], [4], for example, led to a striking extension of the classical Toeplitz–Hausdorff theorem (convexity of $W(M)$): all the $\\Lambda_k(M)$ are convex (though some may be empty), and they are intersections of conveniently computable half–planes in $\\mathbb{C}$. Among the many more recent papers concerning the $\\Lambda_k(M)$, let us mention [5] and [6]. Given a matrix $M\\in M_N$ and $k\\geq1$, Choi, Kribs, and Życzkowski (see [7]) defined the rank–$k$ numerical range of $M$ as . \\[ \\Lambda_k(M)=\\{\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\exists P \\in P_k \\mathrm{such} \\; \\mathrm{that} PMP= \\lambda P\\}, \\] . where $P_k$ denotes the set of rank–$k$ orthogonal projections in $M_N$.

Since then their theory and applications have been advanced with remarkable enthusiasm. Among the many more recent papers concerning the $\\Lambda_k(M)$, let us mention [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] and [6]. Given a matrix $M$ of dimension $d$ and $k\\geq1$, Choi, Kribs, and Życzkowski (see [7], [8]) defined the rank-$k$ numerical range of $M$ as \\[ _k(M)=\\{:PP_kPMP=P\\}, \\] where $P_k$ denotes the set of rank-$k$ orthogonal projections in $M_d$. This definition is natural extention to classical numerical range. It is easy to see that if we considek $k=1$, then $\\Lambda_1(A) = W(A)$ for any matrix $A \\in M_d$. Alternative definitions . Let $M \\in M_d$. Then higher rank-$k$ numerical range of $M$ we can alternatively define as . Equivalently [9], . where $\\lambda_k(X)$ is $k$-th eigenvalue of given matrix $X$. ",

Let $\\1$ denote the $d\\times d$ identity matrix, \\[ p(x)=( x_0 \\1 + x_1 A_1 . | . | x_n A_n ), \\] and consider the complex projective hypersurface \\[ (p)=\\{x^n p(x) = 0 \\}. \\] It was shown that the eigenvalues of $A_1+ A_2$ are the foci of the affine curve of real points \\[ T=\\{ y_1+y_2 y_1,y_2,(1:y_1:y_2) (p)^\\}. \\] Kippenhahn recognized the meaning of the convex hull of $T$. | . | . Theorem . The numerical range of $A_1+\\ii A_2$ is the convex hull of $T$, in other words, $W(A_1+\\ii A_2)=\\text{conv}(T)$. Let we denote $T_i$ as the semi-algebraic set \\[ T_i = \\{ (y_1,,y_n) (n) (1:y_1::y_n)(X_i^)_ \\}, i=1,,r \\] and $(X^{}_i)_{\\text{reg}}$ as the set of the regular points of the dual variety $X^$. Theorem . The joint numerical range $W$ is the convex hull of the Euclidean closure of $T_1\\cup\\cdots\\cup T_r$, in other words, $W = (T_1T_r)$. Classification of JNRs . Two qutrit matrices . This classification comes from [3]. Consider two Hermitian matrices $A_1$ and $A_2$ of size $3 \\times 3$. Then there are four possible shapes of the JNRs . | An oval–object without any flat parts, the boundary is a sextic curve. | Object with one flat part, a convex hull of a quatric curve. | Convex hull of an ellipse and an outside point, which has two flat parts on the boundary. | A triangle (when $A_1$ and $A_2$ commute). This can be further degenerated. | . Three qutrit matrices . This classification is taken from [4] (see for details). Such JNRs must obey the following rules . | In this case we may restrict ourselves to only pure states. | Any flat part in the boundary is the image of the Bloch sphere - two-dimensional subspace of a the sapce of $3 \\times 3$ Hermitian matrices without corner points for | . all configurations of Figure 2. We are unaware of earli . | Two two-dimensional subspaces must share a common point, hence all flat parts are mutually connected. | Convex geometry of a three-dimensional Euclidean space supports up to four mutually intersecting ellipses. | If three ellipses are present in the boundary, the geometry does not allow for existence of any additional segment. | If two segments are present in the boundary, there exist an infinite number o other segments. | . All configurations permitted by these rules are realized. Let us denote by $e$ the number of ellipses in the boundary and by $s$ the number of segments. There exists object with [5]: . | no flat parts in boundary at all $e=0$, $s=0$, | one segment in the boundary $e=0$, $s=1$, | one ellipse in the boundary $e=1$, $s=0$, | one ellipse and a segment $e=1$, $s=1$, | two ellipses in the boundry $e=2$, $s=0$, | two ellipses and a segment $e=2$, $s=1$, | three ellipses $e=3$, $s=0$, | four ellipses $e=4$, $s=0$, | . Additionally in the qutrit case, if there exist of the JNR, the following configurations are possible: . | JNR is the convex hull of an ellipsoid and a point outside the ellipsoid, $e=0$, $s=\\infty$, | JNR is the convex hull of an ellipse and a point outside the affine hull of the ellipse, $e=1$, $s=\\infty$, | .

The $p$-th numerical range (also known as matricial numerical range [1]) of the matrix $A \\in M_n$ is defined as [2]. We can observe that $W(n:A) = \\{ U^A U: X _n \\}$and$W(1:A) = W(A)$ as standard numerical range.
